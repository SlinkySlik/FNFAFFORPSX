![1000005687](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f06c5ba2-68e5-4c01-a0c4-733407b57bb8) What is this?

This project focuses on emulations of Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) by getting PlayStation ROM recreations and running them through a Browser emulator
However there seems to be major issues with github not accepting the bin file mainly because of storage issues, except this project to move to another Web-hosting
provider.
That is if I don't find the solution...
